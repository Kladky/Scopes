# Scopes

This project has two basic ideas:

1. Humans look for patterns and meaning in everything. When they don't find these things, they make them up. Maybe a randomly generated horoscope will sometimes be as meaningful as a "real" one?
2. Humans like to share trite, generic advice on Twitter sometimes.

This site generates a horoscope based on tweets
