# LIFE

You can be quiet and reclusive when it comes to expressing feelings, SIGN. Today may be the exception. The aspects can bring real strength to your communication abilities. You'd be wise to seize the opportunity. Take steps to express your feelings by initiating conversations. Words will come much more easily than usual. If there are problems to handle, you will likely find resolutions.

When it comes to issues of love and romance, you're likely to be in a tough situation, SIGN. The problem is that it may seem like there's an element of detachment developing. Your partner may be moving away from you instead of toward you. Either that, or you feel that he or she simply isn't relating to you as intimately as you'd like.

The prospect of failure is not one that you acknowledge. Where other people see risk, you see an opportunity just waiting to be grabbed. This attitude could bring you a lot of success at this time. Friends and colleagues may wonder how you get the guts to do the things you do. It's fine if you take pride in it -- but don't ever ask people why they aren't willing to take such risks themselves. Remember, it takes all kinds

When did you last spend real quality time with your family - not counting regular chores? If it's been a while, today is a good day to do it. If you have children, play with them or go to the park or zoo. If you're single, consider visiting a parent or sibling. Communication is accentuated today. Talk will come readily and easily. Make the most of this by encouraging a bond with loved ones.

Your self-confidence will get you out of any sort of pickle you might be in today, SIGN. Try not to get too emotional about any issue. Make sure that you keep things light and energetic. If you seem to be stuck in the mud, don't just sit there calling for help. Take the initiative to dig yourself out and move to higher ground.

If you're spending time with strangers or acquaintances, a getting-to-know-you session might be in order. A sweet, self-effacing approach is twice as likely to succeed as a bold, bulldozing one. Even if something's old news to you, it might be best to pretend that you're somewhat surprised. That way, other people won't feel silly. Remember, every little niche in society is different; people from other parts of the globe will not have the same frame of reference you do. Sometimes these differences can be assets.

How do you preserve your family history, SIGN? Do you keep mementos in a box, display heirlooms, or make scrapbooks? You most likely realize the value of family history, but you might not preserve it as well as you should. Take steps to record and save precious items and memories from parents, grandparents, siblings, and others. Don't forget your own history, too. One day you will be glad you did.

Try not to get too worked up over other people's actions that don't concern you, SIGN. Recent events may have triggered responses from others that now have a serious effect on you. Take some time to really think about what part you wish to play in this drama. Is it in your best interests to get involved? It's undoubtedly time to distance yourself from the situation.

You may feel as though you're writing and starring in your own personal soap opera today. This might be one of those times when a romantic relationship becomes so complicated and dramatic that it blocks out every other aspect of your life. Remember that you can direct it as well. There isn't as much improv involved as you would think. Decide what you want the ending to be like, and make it so. When things start to get too crazy, a good dose of humor will really help.

Overdue apologies can be made today, SIGN. It isn't easy to admit you're wrong, but the planetary aspects can boost your courage. Rather than stew with regret, meet with the person to make amends. Regardless of any discomfort, you will definitely find that you feel a lot better afterward. Even if the other person isn't receptive, you will be able to say what needs to be said.

Emotionally, you should feel good today, SIGN, so don't let this confidence go to waste. Do things with your sweetheart and turn the dial up on romance. Your inner light is shining brightly, so know that you can use this to illuminate the path for others. Offer a sympathetic ear and comforting shoulder for someone to cry on tonight. People will be drawn to you like steel to a magnet.

Your dreams are more than just random firings of neurons, SIGN. They can indicate unresolved issues, stress, deep desires, and lost memories. They can prove instrumental to understanding yourself and solving problems. Keep a dream journal and you can access the power within your subconscious and all you can learn from it. Examine your recent dreams. See if there's something you need to recognize.

As much as you try to explain things, SIGN, others simply aren't going to see them with your same intensity and do-or-die urgency. Be careful that you don't contrive a series of far-out stories that only partially reflect the truth. Make sure the picture you paint is accurate or else others may lose faith in your judgment.

If you've been tired lately, SIGN, it may be due to stress. Today's aspects bring an added energy to communication. It would be wise to talk about some of the stress. Worry, anxiety, and fear are huge drains on physical and emotional health. Exercise can alleviate some of these. For others, talking is key. Find the most effective ways to rid yourself of such energy drains and feel better.

Feel free to ignite your passion with the help of the people around you, SIGN. Join with those who share similar dreams and make a plan for accomplishing whatever you choose. The more creative you can be with your planning, data collecting, and execution, the better off you will be. The white-hot fire within you is ready to blaze.

It's a good day to express your thoughts and feelings, SIGN. Whether it's a loved one who'd appreciate affectionate words or a colleague who requires instruction, communication will come more easily than usual. You have a practical nature. Often you say what you think is required and not much else. Yet others may need you to say a lot more. Consider this as you go about your day.

You may get caught up in gossip if you aren't careful, SIGN, and people may find this off-putting. The maturity level of the conversation is apt to drop significantly if you insist on talking about others like they're soap opera characters. Build your self-confidence so you're comfortable and you don't need to use other people's lives as topics of discussion.

Spread goodwill and affection today, SIGN. It's been a while since you let people know that you care about and appreciate them. Cards, phone calls, letters, flowers, and hugs are ways to express your feelings. Consider surprising someone with lunch, or making something special for a friend. Make time for emotional as well as intellectual expression. It keeps a healthy balance in your life.

Your enthusiasm is contagious, SIGN, and you should do what you can to share this feeling with others. In matters of the heart, have confidence that you know exactly where you stand. You also have the map of the surrounding area and beyond. You have the ability to get to any place you want to go. Accept the power that comes from strong connections in you and with people around you.

If a problem comes your way today, SIGN, look for the simplest solution. Not every problem is complicated. Often the most obvious answer is the best one. Try to keep your emotions out of problems that require calculation and thought. They can obscure the view and keep you from seeing what's right in front of you. Draw strength from your common sense. Rule things out by process of elimination.

You may be at a high point right now and feeling very excited about things to come, SIGN. You probably anticipate but have only a vague notion of what's just over the horizon. You may have a strong desire to rise high so you can see farther. In fact, you probably think that any place is better than your current spot. Have confidence in your future. It looks extremely bright.

It's a good day to speak your mind, SIGN. Not that you generally have much trouble with this. But even you can face situations where you feel intimidated and hesitant to speak up. Not today. There aren't going to be any circumstances you can't handle, because the astral energy will boost your abilities. If there's someone you've been reluctant to approach, make a move to talk to him or her.

Let your heart be the reassuring force in your life today if difficult emotional issues come to the surface, SIGN. Your feelings are apt to be at a climactic point in your month. Your general sensitivity toward the world is heightened. Try not to get too weighed down by these inner stirrings.

Expect a boost to your communication skills today, SIGN. If you often experience difficulty expressing your true feelings, this will be a welcome change for you. Consider talking things over with anyone you have unresolved issues with. With added strength and confidence, you should be able to work the problems out quickly and relatively painlessly.

Be open and communicative about your feelings today, SIGN. Most people find it easy to share facts or concrete information. The challenge is to share something from your heart. Don't think that feelings always need to be kept secret. Just the opposite is true. Make sure you leave the channels open for emotional expression.

If something has been bothering you, SIGN, today is a good time to work it out. Your excellent communicative ability will be even stronger with today's energy. Whether your problems have to do with a colleague, boss, spouse, friend, or relative, you will find the words to effectively communicate your thoughts and feelings. Don't hesitate to make those appointments.

When you enter a room, SIGN, the dynamic suddenly changes. Your presence has a powerful impact on other people. Don't take it lightly. People may hang on your words like they're listening to the queen address to her kingdom. Make sure the content of your speech reflects the gravity of the situation. Make every word count.

You're struggling with your inner demons. No one can even see them but you, so don't expect anyone to offer you help. But do feel free to ask for some. As long as it doesn't involve money, people will give freely.

It's easier to solve other people's problems than your own -- but you have to start looking at what's right in front of your nose. That's why it's a good time to forget about everyone else's dilemmas and special needs. You didn't sign up to be everyone else's psychotherapist -- you have your own problems! Does it really make you feel that guilty? Or are you just a little less than enthusiastic about facing up to the problems in your own domain?

Make sure everyone around you has plenty to talk about for the next week or so. You're out to have fun today and you won't be stopped by any petty-minded peons or frowning naysayers. You're liable to attract quite a fun and lively crowd. You don't need to find the party -- you can start one all on your own. Send someone a surprise striptease or a certain cutie a huge bouquet of balloons. Turn the tables. Break the mold.

You may be forced to pass on an exciting event due to family or work obligations. While everyone else compliments you on your oh-so-responsible attitude, you might be gritting your teeth and wishing you could throw responsibility out the window. Sadly, you've embraced it too tightly for too long; now you're all tangled up. Maybe you should think about pulling back gradually from your duties. That way, you can be spontaneous without dropping the ball. If you think you can rearrange things on short notice, go for it.

It's a good time to assess your progress at work or your vocation. You've made great strides, and with any luck, some good connections as well. What is the next step going to be? Maybe you want to expand operations, either for yourself or for an entire organization. Definitely get other people's opinions, no matter what you're up to. Friends, colleagues and respected acquaintances have a lot to add. Plenty of questions will probably be asked and answered.

Some of your more materially minded friends might convince you to make a huge purchase. Are you suddenly a status shopper? This may entail more of a financial commitment than you want to make. It's easy to grab the latest clothing trend, cool car, and chic vacation spot. The overhead, however, might be a lot more than you can handle. Just because everyone else is mired in credit card debt doesn't mean you have to be. Break free of the buy-it-now mindset.

Very little could put a damper on your high spirits today -- in fact, it's more than likely you'll bring other people's energy up. You know just the right thing to say to make someone feel better about whatever. Most of what you say is sincere, too. No wonder you're at the top of everyone's social lists. Check your email and voicemail often -- you'll probably get a steady stream of messages. A happy surprise may be on its way.

From the starting point, the finish line looks far, far away. However, once you hit your stride, you'll eat up the distance like it's nothing. It doesn't matter whether you're working out, taking on a new business project or changing your entire lifestyle. The same rules apply: Concentrate on the moment. Put every ounce of energy into the task at hand. You'll be exhausted when you finish -- but you'll finish far sooner than you might expect.

Join an activity group or a professional organization. It's a good way to meet people with similar interests -- especially when you're in the mood to get out and mingle with like-minded people. It's all well and good to be independent and self-sufficient -- just not all the time. Romance may have to take a back seat to camaraderie. Dating games are just not nearly as interesting as good conversation.

Don't give advice unless someone asks for it specifically. If you can manage to keep a low profile, the office hothead will probably sweep right by you without a second glance. That may prove difficult, if only because you're in the mood to call out the bully and fight them on their own turf. A noble desire, to be sure, but perhaps not the wisest one in the long run. Let the boss solve the problem -- that's what she gets paid for!

# LOVE

All kinds of group activities are meaningful for you, with today's scintillating celestial energy. If you are already involved in a wonderful partnership, then you will find the people you meet up with enhance your current relationship no end. If you are looking for companionship, then all you need do is become involved in conversation and see what happens next. You could be in for a big surprise.

What they say about all work and no play just doesn't apply to you right now. You're likely to be exceptionally involved with career matters -- yet you're looking hot and getting lots of attention while you're at it.

Right now, your differences -- not your similarities -- are the things that will help produce a better relationship, so savor the clash of personalities. See where it gives you new opportunities in this situation.

Today's aspect significantly broadens your horizons. You may strike up an interesting conversation while at a SIGNry, or even in a bookstore while browsing through the latest best-seller list. But the discussion is likely to continue for far longer than you initially imagined. It could take a long time for you both to actually complete it. Before you know it, you'll be dating on a regular basis.

Romance is very much a matter of humor, especially with the current astral energy. Although you are more concerned with image and looks than with making others laugh, it is your particular approach to life that seems to have someone really gorgeous in stitches. You obviously have a lot to share and discover about each other - and looking on the bright side helps a lot. Good times lie ahead.

The current aspect means you have a wonderful opportunity to make amends with your partner (current or prospective) after a time when you may have found it difficult to communicate properly. You will realize the folly of your ways and find the confidence and warm-heartedness to approach each other from a more positive stance. Take the time to go out and have some fun, as laughter will work wonders for you both.

There is a lot of good humor around with today's astral energy. But if you want to truly impress someone, then don't overdo it, as you may put them off, rather than turn them on. It is difficult for you not to attempt to raise a smile wherever you are, but there is a time and a place for everything. With this person, it is best to be subtler.

The current planetary energy will certainly brighten up your life, especially where romance is concerned. You tend to have a very dry sense of humor, so it is sometimes hard for others to tell whether you are joking or not. Yet you will meet a certain person who not only understands your jokes, but can give as good as they get. You will deeply appreciate all they have to offer.

Whatever you do, you can't stay in and do nothing - not with today's planetary energy. You absolutely have to wear your best clothes and get out. In fact if you do go to a party, you are guaranteed to have lots and lots of fun. You will also meet others who love to talk endlessly about all the secrets and mysteries of the universe, much as you do.

The astral energy encourages you to invite a few friends around for an impromptu party, so that you and a loved one can relax in good company and enjoy an evening of tales and jokes. If you both want to seriously improve your love life, then do the same, alone, with oysters, champagne, and an aromatic hot tub thrown in for good measure. You WILL want to repeat this experience.

It is your great sense of humor that comes to the rescue in terms of one significant relationship. Today's aspect gives you just the edge you need in the communications department to help you to get around a certain argument that a loved one may put forward. You won't win by trying to force the issue, or by burying your head in the sand, but by making them laugh.

The current astral configuration will certainly give you all the powers of conversation that you could possibly need in order to persuade a very desirable person of the fact that you appreciate them deeply. Up until today you may have found yourself tongue-tied, but all of suddenly the verbal floodgates are opened, and you are able to discuss just about anything with flare, confidence, and wit.

It seems that you can't fail today, with the interplay of planetary energies on your side. Whatever meetings or social occasions you attend, you will find that they are extremely successful, and that you are the center of attention. Because of your supreme confidence, you may find that one particular person is extremely attracted to you, and wants to engage you in some artful conversation. Right now you have nothing to lose.

A more profound understanding of some issue (or a certain someone) in your love life is within your grasp now -- probably because you're even more grounded than usual. Look deeper and learn.

You and your sweetie have been steadily making progress in this relationship -- really. Just don't look back at how high you've climbed -- you might be overcome by the heights you two have reached.

The current astral alignment indicates that your love life may blossom in a spiritual setting, perhaps at a meditation course or some kind of yoga retreat. This blending of minds and hearts certainly seems to occur while you are away from your normal daily routine, perhaps on some kind of vacation, or while enjoying a few days break. It will be deeply satisfying to both of you.

If it seems like there's something going on that you're not privy to in the realm of romance, this is most likely true right now. Be honest with yourself and with others, and seek the clarity that you need.

Plants and relationships have a lot in common: You can't tend them once a month and expect them to thrive. Check in with your sweetheart. You two need to spend more time with each other.

It looks like work could be your primary challenge at the moment, and just getting through the day takes plenty of energy. But the energy you put into really noticing those around you pays off now.

Follow through on your promises, and this relationship will take a turn for the better. While part of you is reluctant to commit yourself even further, you can't turn away these current obligations. Be a grown-up.

Yes, there's a time for bold action when it comes to the realm of romance. Is this it? Most likely, no. Don't do or say something you might wish you could retract; instead, wait a bit and gather more info.

Romantically speaking, you two are on target. When it comes to personal challenges, you leap over tall buildings in a single bound. Have you thought about taking this duo into the realm of business? You'd make a killing.

Persevere in the realm of romance now -- it'll pay off handsomely. The universe loves a good-faith effort in the love department, and it's ready to reward positivity and even blind faith.

Your sweetie thinks you're in danger of becoming a workaholic. That's far from the truth. In fact, you love having fun -- you just like it to have a point. Maybe you two could start doing the crosswords together.

Something (or someone) is upsetting your usual balance now, and it's definitely disconcerting. You may feel thrown off, but there's also an opportunity here for some personal growth and forward motion.

Start sooner rather than later. The two of you have been thinking about this grand plan for ages now. The stars say the time is right, so get moving. If you hesitate, this opportunity may be lost for good.

The mysteries of love can't help but reveal themselves in the face of your curiosity and tenacity -- well, a few of the mysteries, anyway. You wouldn't want it all given away anyhow!

It's hard for you to separate your personal feelings from your darling's current circumstances. Just remember that the situation -- and your sweetie's feelings -- aren't really about you. Be clear about who you are.

You're likely feeling unusually protective when it comes to the realm of romance, whether you're unwilling to take a risk with your heart or you're guarding a friend's best interests. Follow that instinct.

You're pushing so hard because you want to ensure that you and your darling have some kind of security. Is it worth sacrificing your present for what you think should be your future? Spend time at home now.

You've got that certain something, a way of sparking fascination and admiration without even trying. Of course, if you do try, the results you'll get will be even more interesting.

You're super-organized and efficient, and you hate not getting to the point. These are all qualities that work wonders in your professional life, but your sweetie might view your tactics as controlling. Be gentle.

Being all over the place and letting romance happen as it may is one way to play, but right now, the stars say getting a little organized about it helps a great deal. Make a game plan -- maybe with a friend.

Why tackle this adventure solo when your sweetheart is more than willing to accompany you? In fact, they have prior experience about this kind of endeavor. That's very reassuring -- to both of you!

A coworker may play an unexpected role in the realm of romance now -- perhaps offering some useful advice, or maybe telling a story that provides an 'a-ha' moment for you with regard to your current situation.

These industrious celestial energies emphasize tangible accomplishments. You and your sweetheart get down to business, and each new achievement inspires you two to do more and more.

# CAREER

Have faith that the new idea that comes to you is a sound one and one that you should pursue with courage. There is no reason to doubt yourself or your abilities. You are coming into a very favorable time during which you can accomplish a great deal.

It seems harder and harder to achieve your financial goals, but it's getting easier and easier to reach your social goals. The weekend holds much for you, if you can take your mind off of money. Use today to tie up all necessary loose ends so you can do just that.

Make sure that your communication is genuine and passionate. If there is an undertone of anger, frustration, or unhappiness, the people you are communicating with will not be very responsive or supportive of your needs. Be honest and stay positive.

You are very knowledgeable when it comes to a certain skill or trade. You know a particular area inside and out. This doesn't mean, however, that you know everything. You should still consult others when it comes to things you know nothing about.

Let an old idea die. You may be working on a premise that is outdated or outmoded. Let go of this idea and find something new. Ask someone else for his or her opinion on the matter. A fresh perspective will do you good. Don't be afraid to reach out.

You have reached a slow-down in the road. You are at a point of suspension. The more you struggle, the more you will be bound to a situation that you are not comfortable in. Let go of control and be patient. Wait this one out. Your time will come.

Someone with a very strong will is taking control and trying to call the shots on every aspect of your career. What is good for that person is not necessarily good for you. Don't get trapped in this person's iron-grip. Do things your own way.

Every day gives you a new chance for a new start. You will find that a fresh attitude on your end helps to repair a difficult attitude on someone else's end. In short, small changes you make from within yourself ultimately help everyone around you.

Important insight comes to you. This insight allows for healing of your current situation. Be open to these new ways of resolving tension. If you aren't able to heal yourself and the predicament you are in, you will not make progress in your work.

Important insight comes to you. This insight allows for healing of your current situation. Be open to these new ways of resolving tension. If you aren't able to heal yourself and the predicament you are in, you will not make progress in your work.

Your thinking is clear and grounded. You will learn important details that will help you put together your master plan. Fit the big pieces into place first and then let the details fill in the holes. Everything is coming into position as it should.

If one of your facts is off, then people are going to have very little reason to believe in anything else you say. Don't give people misinformation. Check the details more than once before you present your case. Make your first impression a good one.

There is a primal urge within you. Love is ultimately the motivating force for everything that you do. If love doesn't play into the picture one way or another, than the work you are doing will not be very successful. Find a way to love your work.

You have the ability to be an effective and practical leader. You can unite the troops and get the job done. Don't just earn favor with people and do nothing. Earn favor with them and then present a goal or a project. The results will be fantastic.

You may end the day feeling like a completely different person than you were when you woke up this morning. That can be disorienting but it just goes to show how easily influenced you are by those around you. Try to keep your own opinions when it comes to spending.

Don't expect to make your fortune today, especially if you don't work alone. You have no patience for monkeying around, but it's hard to get others to stay focused on anything but play. You can try going it alone or simply give in and start your weekend early.

Your pride thwarts all efforts to function today, or so it feels. Every interaction is like a clash of the titans. Keep your ego in check if you want to avoid being overthrown by a younger, stronger god.

Things are somehow different today, even though your regular schedule is unfolding as it should. That little feeling that things have changed will nag you all day long -- unless you find its source. It has to do with money.

You feel connected to everyone today. That could be misleading, though. Just because you think you understand others inside and out doesn't mean you really do. Don't make any assumptions.

Don't count on the placid exteriors you're shown early in the day. They belie the bubbling lava just under the surface. Things erupt when you least expect them, and that changes the way things look to you -- and it has nothing to do with redecorating.

You can't expect to handle new problems in old ways. It's possible you can come up with a unique solution on your own but much more likely if you exchange ideas with others. Keep lines of communication open.

It's important to think positively but you may be taking that attitude a bit too far. Preparing for the future means being ready for outcomes you don't necessarily really expect. Start working on your rainy day fund.

Your brilliant ideas are just that -- brilliant. Don't be afraid to be shot down. People will be impressed with what you've come up with but not with your lack of initiative. Speaking up is your first step.

You're no sage, that's for sure. In fact, you're often completely unrealistic when it comes to your notions of the future. That's okay if you stick with the group; they'll keep you grounded in common sense.
